# NE_Global-R
The New Earth_Global-Recursive model (NE_Global-R) is a recursive-dynamic global energy system model, which was developed by OTSUKI Takashi (Associate Professor, Yokohama National University), KOMIYAMA Ryoichi (Professor, The University of Tokyo), and FUJII Yasumasa (Professor, The University of Tokyo). This linear programming model covers the entire energy sector with an hourly temporal resolution for electricity balances (24 hours for consecutive 365 days) for a total of 100 regions in the world. The analysis period is from 2015 to 2050 with five representative years (2015, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050). The model considers 28 types of primary and secondary energy carriers, as well as 250 types of technologies or processes for energy production, transformation, transportation, and final consumption.
